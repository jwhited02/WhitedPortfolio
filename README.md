# Jackson Whited's Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases 4 projects I submitted during my time at Northwestern University's Data Science Bootcamp. These projects were completed in groups, and the role I played in each is as follows:

## Car Prices Analysis

My main responsibility for the Car Price Analysis was the actual analysis in the ReadMe, and the presentation itself. 

## Crowdfunding_ETL Analysis

I completed cells 68-80 in the Jupyter Notebook for this group project.

## Movie Analysis

My role in this project was to clean the CSV file we used, and also analyze the Profit vs. Rating and the Opening Weekend Sales vs. Overall Worldwide Sales. I also created the visualizations for all of the scatter plots in the project. 

## Tornado Analysis

My main role in the tornado analysis project was to analyze the magnitudes of Tornadoes across the USA in 2023, and create an interactive bubble map showcasing my findings. To do this, I used JavaScript and more specifically Leaflet. I also came up with the idea for the project as a whole.
