# Jackson Whited's Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases 4 projects I submitted during my time at Northwestern University's Data Science Bootcamp. These projects were completed in groups, and the role I played in each is as follows:

## Tornado Analysis

My main role in the tornado analysis project was to analyze the magnitudes of Tornadoes across the USA in 2023, and create an interactive bubble map showcasing my findings. To do this, I used JavaScript and more specifically Leaflet. I also came up with the idea for the project as a whole. 

## Car Prices Analysis

My main responsibility for the Car Price Analysis was the actual analysis in the ReadMe, and the presentation itself.
